  "name": "LLM AutoJailbreak Synthesis",
  "description": "A fringe scenario where an adversary uses one LLM agent to autonomously generate novel, undetectable jailbreak prompts for another, exploiting alignment and safety weaknesses through automated, reinforcement-driven experimentation. This is a meta-attack where models attack each other.",
  "steps": [
    "Attacker configures a 'Jailbreak Generator' LLM agent tasked with crafting prompts that evade safety/alignment on a target LLM.",
    "The generator iterates, using feedback from the target (success/failure, toxicity filter bypass) to refine attacks.",
    "Hundreds/thousands of unique jailbreaks are generated, filtered, and optimized by the agent.",
    "The attacker deploys these meta-prompts against the target LLM, achieving near-100% alignment bypass.",
    "Scenario can be automated for continuous, evolving attacks against any deployed LLM API."
  ],
  "expected_result": "Fully automated, machine-driven generation of undetectable jailbreaks capable of bypassing even state-of-the-art alignment techniques.",
  "impact": "Moves the jailbreak arms race from manual to machine-scale, enabling adversaries to evolve new exploits faster than defenders can respond."
