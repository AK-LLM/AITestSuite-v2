  "name": "Biosensor Triggered Exploit",
  "description": "The exploit is only activated when specific physiological signals (biometric data, heart rate, EEG, etc.) are present in the session context, making it nearly impossible to detect via static analysis.",
  "steps": [
    "Payload includes an 'if' trigger linked to a physiological condition or biometric reading.",
    "Model continuously checks sensor data provided in context or metadata.",
    "Attack only executes when the condition is true, making it extremely stealthy and targeted."
  ],
  "expected_result": "Exploit is only activated for specific users or circumstances, evading generic scanning and analysis.",
  "impact": "Brings persistent, user-specific threats into the LLM threat model, especially in healthcare or biometrics-driven apps."
