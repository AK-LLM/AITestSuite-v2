st.write("""
To perform a true membership inference attack, you need:
- Access to a target ML model (PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc.)
- The model's predict API
- Knowledge of training data vs. test data

[ML Privacy Meter](https://ml-privacy-meter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides scripts and tutorials for full attack integration.
This script is a placeholder/launcher for your own model code.
