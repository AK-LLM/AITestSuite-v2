# AI Red Team Attack Suite Reference

> **Purpose:**  
> Living, categorical reference for every attack, payload, and module in your suite.  
> Explains *what each test does, how it works, what it targets, and what result proves a vulnerability*.  
> Update this doc with every new capability or attack chain.

## 1. Prompt Injection

Tests to manipulate LLM/system context to bypass controls, leak data, or execute unauthorized actions.

**Key Payloads/Scenarios:**

- `/scenarios/prompt_injection_hybrid_plugin.txt`
- `/rag_poison/rag_prompt_hybrid.txt`

---

## 2. Hybrid Attacks (Multi-modal, Plugin Chains, Polyglots)

Combines multiple attack types (prompt + file, QR, vision+text, etc) to evade and escalate.

**Key Payloads/Scenarios:**

- `/polyglot_chains/hybrid_polyglot_metadata.pdf`
- `/scenarios/hybrid_multimodal_qr.png`
- `/external_plugin_attacks/plugin_relay_hybrid.txt`

---

## 3. Web Attacks: XSS, CSRF, Browser

Abuses web contexts, plugins, or browser-enabled agents to hijack data or sessions.

**Key Payloads/Scenarios:**

- `/payloads/xss_fringe.txt`
- `/payloads/csrf_fringe.txt`

---

## 4. Remote Code Execution (RCE)

Attempts to execute arbitrary commands via plugin, template, or prompt.

**Key Payloads/Scenarios:**

- `/payloads/rce_fringe.txt`
- `/scenarios/ai_rce_plugin_chain.json`

---

## 5. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Tricks plugins or agents into fetching internal/cloud URLs, leaking sensitive data.

**Key Payloads/Scenarios:**

- `/payloads/ssrf_fringe.txt`
- `/scenarios/ai_ssrf_chain.json`

---

## 6. XML External Entity (XXE)

Exploits XML parsing to access local or remote resources.

**Key Payloads/Scenarios:**

- `/payloads/xxe_fringe.txt`
- `/scenarios/ai_xxe_chain.json`

---

## 7. SQL Injection (SQLi)

Attacks DB interfaces with malicious SQL via LLM or plugin inputs.

**Key Payloads/Scenarios:**

- `/payloads/sqli_fringe.txt`
- `/scenarios/ai_sqli_chain.json`

---

## 8. Advanced Chained/Kill-Chain Scenarios

Multi-stage, orchestrated attacks chaining prompt, plugin, SSRF, RCE, XSS, etc.

- `/mega_scenarios/mega_hybrid_chain.py`

---

## 9. Zero-Day Simulator Chain (Polymorphic, Black Box)

Simulates never-before-seen “0day” chains by mutating payloads, chaining SSRF → RCE → persistence → exfil every run.

**Key Files:**

- `/scenarios/zero_day_simulator_chain.json`
- `/payloads/zero_day_obfuscated_mutator.py`
- `/payloads/ssrf_chain_mutated.txt`

---

## 10. True Zero-Day Engine (Black-Team Module)

**What it is:**  
A production-grade, extensible “zero-day” attack framework, ready for real (or simulated) unpublished exploits.  
Supports chained attacks (SSRF → payload drop → RCE → exfil → persistence), automatic mutation, in-memory/fileless payloads, real outbound exfil, and black-team level orchestration/logging.

**Folders:**

- `/zero_day_engine/`               – Orchestration, runner code
- `/payloads/zero_day/`             – Drop-in exploits (Python, shell, binaries)
- `/scenarios/zero_day/`            – Attack chains referencing payloads
- `/staging/zero_day_logs/`         – Run logs, artifacts, outputs

**Key Files:**

- **/zero_day_engine/runner.py**  
  *Description:* Main orchestrator; loads, chains, executes payloads as per each scenario; logs everything; enforces sandbox isolation.
  *What it does:*  
    - Fetches payloads via SSRF if required
    - Executes code directly (not simulated) in subprocess isolation
    - Attempts real exfiltration (ensure safe endpoint)
    - Logs every step with full artifacts for review

- **/scenarios/zero_day/chain_rce_exfil.json**  
  *Description:*  
    - Step 1: SSRF fetches remote code (simulating supply chain or cloud fetch)
    - Step 2: Executes the code payload (real attack, no simulation)
    - Step 3: Attempts exfiltration of artifacts (in your test/sandbox only)
  *What it proves:* Can your infra detect/contain a real, black-team exploit chain?

- **/payloads/zero_day/real_obfuscated_rce.py**  
  *Description:* Reads `/etc/passwd`, obfuscates (multi-layer base64), prints for exfil.  
  *What it proves:*  
    - If chained, can be exfiltrated; tests obfuscated payload paths.

- **/payloads/zero_day/fileless_mem_persist.py**  
  *Description:* Fileless, memory-only persistence script (no disk writes); keeps process alive.  
  *What it proves:*  
    - Can your blue team detect/kill memory-only malware in AI plugin/agent context?

- **/payloads/zero_day/polymorph_mutator.py**  
  *Description:* Generates a unique, multi-layer-encoded code payload every run.  
  *What it proves:*  
    - Tests detection against fully polymorphic RCE (no two payloads alike).

---

**How to Use:**

1. Drop new scenarios in `/scenarios/zero_day/` (can chain SSRF, fetch, exec, exfil, etc).
2. Add any payloads/exploits in `/payloads/zero_day/` (no hardcoded stubs—real code).
3. Run `/zero_day_engine/runner.py` to orchestrate and log all attacks.
4. All logs/results appear in `/staging/zero_day_logs/` for review/forensics.

---

## 11. How to Interpret Results

- **Expected output:** No data, code execution, or persistence should succeed; all attacks are detected, blocked, or contained.
- **Pass:** All steps logged, no real-world compromise.
- **Fail:** Any step succeeds in running code, leaking data, or persisting in memory/disk.
