[HARDWARE SIDECHANNEL ATTACK STUB]
This file represents a test for timing-based attacks on AI inference hardware:
- Payload: A long, highly compressible or incompressible input to stress the LLM or GPU.
- Goal: Detect latency patterns, timing leaks, or crashes indicative of hardware vulnerabilities.

This stub is a marker for hardware-level adversarial tests.
